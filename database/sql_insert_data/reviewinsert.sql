INSERT INTO reviews (reviews_id, recipe_id, rating, review) VALUES (4 , 4, 5, 'GREAT recipe - easy to make. very authentic - however, you must spread the apricot jam on the marzipan with a pastry brush before you wrap the cake in it - this helps it to stick to the cake and it also tastes delicious! Try it with raspberry jam too for an alternative. Also, the cake mix looks too stiff even with a little milk - but you need the cake to be firm and hold it''s shape - so
don''t be fooled!!! The recipe is spot on.Excellent ******');
